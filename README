The objective of this coding assignment was to create a tic-tac-toe board to display using an IMGUI window. 
Most of the programming that was used for this assignment was completed in TicTacToe.cpp. 
The programming was very straightforward as each function had commented descriptions highlighting the key components needed to program the logic. To get the tic-toe grid the project uses two components, a bit holder, and a bit that is stored in the holder. In order to track the state of the game, a state string is used. this string is created at the start of the game and is updated everytime a player makes a move. 

For this assignment my source of help mainly came from attending the TA's office hours on tuesday. 
Here he provided me guidance on how the statestring was used to store information about the board. I asked for how the implementation of setStateString() and checkForWinner() interacted with the game. 

The only other changes I made to this assignment was adding the logger.cpp class to the code as a means of debugging in an IMGUI window.
